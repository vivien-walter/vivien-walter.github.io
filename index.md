### Welcome to my Github Page

My name is **Vivien WALTER** and I am a young teacher and researcher in **Biophysics**. While most of my research is performed as experiments in the laboratories, I use a lot my passion for computers and essentially **software programming** to assist me in my work. Recently, I also developed a huge interest for numerical **Molecular Dynamics** simulations with *GROMACS*, which I often use for research purpose too.

This website is dedicated to my work in programming, and you will find here many sides of my work:
- Scripts and software for **data** and **image processing** in experimental science
- Scripts for **MD simulations**, essentially based on GROMACS
- Various **tutorials** on programming.

If you are looking for more informations about the thematics of my research, I suggest you to take a look at my [main personnal website](http://vwalter.fr "Vivien Walter's Website")
