I am <b>Vivien Walter</b>, a Research Associate in <b>soft matter</b> and <b>biophysics</b>. I recently joined the Mark Wallace group
in the Department of Chemistry at the <b>King's College London</b> (UK). My main research interests are the physics of <b>lipid membranes</b>,
their properties and interactions with various biomolecules. To investigate the lipid molecules, I am using both
<b>fluorescence and interferometric microscopy</b>, as well as <b>molecular dynamics simulations</b>.
Conjugating my activities with my passion for <b>programmation</b>, I am constantly creating and developing new softwares to analyse the
data we collect in our experiments.

<br>

You will find on my website obviously information about my <b>Research</b> activities, but also all the <b>Softwares</b> I have
developed and published for my research. Being a former teacher, training is essential for me; which is why I am always uploading the
tutorials and lessons I am making in the <b>Teaching</b> section. If after all of that you are curious and what to know more <b>About me</b>,
please visit the dedicated section.
