MLLPA (<ins>M</ins>achine <ins>L</ins>earning-assisted <ins>L</ins>ipid <ins>P</ins>hase <ins>A</ins>nalysis) is a Python 3 library
developed to analyse lipid membranes generated during molecular dynamics (MD) simulation runs in order to
**predict the phase** of each lipid and map the **local environment** of the lipids in the bilayer.

The **complete documentation** of the software, as well as some **tutorials**, can be found on the related [GitHub page](https://github.com/vivien-walter/mllpa).
