My PhD thesis was part of a collaboration with Prof. **Ashutosh Chilkoti** and Dr. **Sarah MacEwan** from [Duke University](http://chilkotilab.pratt.duke.edu), USA) to study how temperature could trigger the cellular uptake of cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) via self-assembly of elastin-like polypeptides (ELP) with the temperature. More details on the project can be found here.
