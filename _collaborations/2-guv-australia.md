title: "GUV on Dragonfly Wings"
---

I have worked previously with Drs. **Samuel Cheeseman** and **Vi Khanh Truong** from Prof. **Elena P. Ivanova** group
at the [Swinburne University of Technology](https://www.swinburne.edu.au) for the study of the interactions of Giant-Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs)
with Dragonfly wings. The results on this collaboration were published in Langmuir (LINK).
