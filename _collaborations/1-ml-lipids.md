title: "Machine Learning for Lipid Phase Analysis"
active: true

I am currently working in close collaboration with Drs. **Celine Ruscher**, **Olivier Benzerara** and **Fabrice Thalmann**
from the [Institut Charles Sadron](https://www.ics-cnrs.unistra.fr) (CNRS, Universite de Strasbourg, FR)
for the study of lipid bilayers in Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations using Machine Learning. We are often supported
on this project by Drs. **Carlos M. Marques** and **Adrien Gola**, also from the Institut Charles Sadron, and by
Dr. **Tiago Espinosa de Oliveira** (BR). For more information on this collaboration, please check the section [Lipid Thermodynamic Phase](/research/#project-lipid-phase)
above.
