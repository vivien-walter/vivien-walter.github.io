title: "Imaging the reaction of polymerisation"
active: true

Through my project on iSCAT, I joined a collaboration between the King's College London and the
Prof. **Rachel O'Reilly** and Dr. **Jeffrey Foster** from the [University of Birmingham](https://www.oreillygrouplab.com) (Birmingham, UK).
Through this collaboration, we aim at imaging polymers with our iSCAT microscope and study their properties.
