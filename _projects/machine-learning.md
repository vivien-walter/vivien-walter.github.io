<hr>

In collaboration with the [Institut Charles Sadron](https://www.ics-cnrs.unistra.fr) (Strasbourg, FR), I am investigating the thermodynamic
properties of lipid membranes generated by **molecular dynamics (MD) simulations**. My specific interest are the phase transitions and separations
that can occur when the temperature of the system vary. Using **Machine Learning** to analyse the lipid configurations, we aim at describing
complex lipid mixtures and phases using a two-state approach.

## Description

### Lipid phases

One of the remarkable property of pure phospholipids bilayers is to exhibit thermodynamic transitions, meaning that they can be found in several phases; from the dense structured **gel phase** at low temperature to the fully **disordered fluid phase** which forms above a sharp transition called the melting transition. Many other phases have been identified in the last decades, such as the corrugated **ripple phase** appearing between the gel and fluid phases of phosphocholine (PC) lipids, or the **ordered liquid phase** formed by the presence of an important amount of cholesterol in the membranes.

We investigate thoroughly these different phases via MD simulations in order to fully characterise the lipid membranes simulated. This allow us to track interactions between various types of molecules, such as **pollutants**, and the membrane; and analyse how these molecules are able to **modify the phase composition** of the lipid membranes.

### Machine Learning

To analyse the phases of the individual lipid composing a cell membrane, we decided to rely on **Machine Learning** (ML) analysis.
Our key concept is that the configurations of lipid molecules is expected to be radically different from the **elongated densely packed gel** phase
to the **randomly oriented fluid phase**. ML analysis have been for long proven critically efficient on differenciating objects by
their appearance, which we tried to apply here to lipids.

Our first codes were found extremely efficient at differentiating lipid phases (Check the section *Related publication(s)* below), with an **average score of 95%**
for most of the lipids used in all-atom. We are looking for different way to proceed, especially to **unify all models and lipids types**.
