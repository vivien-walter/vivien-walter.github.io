In collaboration with the [Institut Charles Sadron](https://www.ics-cnrs.unistra.fr) (Strasbourg, FR), I am investigating the thermodynamic
properties of lipid membranes generated by **molecular dynamics (MD) simulations**. My specific interest are the phase transitions and separations
that can occur when the temperature of the system vary. Using **Machine Learning** to analyse the lipid configurations, we aim at describing
complex lipid mixtures and phases using a two-state approach.
