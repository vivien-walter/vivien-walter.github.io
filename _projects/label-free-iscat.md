As part of the [Wallace group](http://markwallace.org) at King's College London, I am
investigating label-free optical imaging of single molecules, using **Interferometric Scattering**
(iSCAT) microscopy. Using the fact that all particles can scatter light beams and that this scattered
beam can interfere with a reference light beam, we are able to image on our microscope individual metal particles
as small as 2nm and **individual proteins and polymers as small as 100kg/mol** at ultra high speeds (> 10kHz).
Going beyond the limitations in space and time resolutions of other types of optical microscopes, we use this
technique to visualize key **events and reactions in cells** and other standard biophysical systems.
