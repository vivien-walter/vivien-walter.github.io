<p>The AutoCorrelation function (ACF) is a <strong>plugin</strong> made for <strong>ImageJ</strong> which enable
the user to perform autocorrelation calculations in <strong>both space and time</strong> on an
image or a sequence of images. The plugin returns the <em>characteristic time and distance</em>
of the images.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>The ACF plugin reads an <strong>image or sequence of images</strong> and uses the pixel values to
measure the <strong>characteristic autocorrelation times and distances</strong>.</p>

<p>These characteristic times and distances can be seen as the <em>average period or distances at which one pixel value will be repeated</em>.
They can be used to calculate the typical frequency of a fluctuation or the size of domains on an image.</p>

<p>ACF can also perform the measurement of the autocorrelation in time after doing the <strong>Fourier transform</strong> of the image.
By doing so, the different ranges of spatial frequencies are analysed separately to extract their
period of oscillation in time.</p>

<h3 id="space-correlation">Space correlation</h3>

<p>The correlation in space, which is an 2-D ACF, can be calculated via <strong>two different algorithms</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A fast calculation can be made by computing the <strong>FFT</strong> of the image first. The <strong>Wiener-Khinchin theorem</strong>
indeed specify that the autocorrelation is simply given by the <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Wiener-KhinchinTheorem.html">Fourier transform of the absolute square of the signal</a>.
Unfortunately, the FFT in ImageJ can only be made on images with a size N = 2^k, which means that images
with a different size will need to be resized first. It also raises problem at the edge of the region
of interest where the signal stops brutally.</li>
  <li>The second method to calculate the ACF is to use the rough definition and <strong>multiply each pixel value Ixy with all the other pixel values Ix’y’</strong>,
such as the distance xy to x’y’ is equal to a given radius r. With this methods, there is no issue on the
edge of the image but the calculation is relatively slow.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="time-correlation">Time correlation</h3>

<p>The time correlation, which is a 1-D ACF, is simply done by <strong>multiplying each pixel value Ixy(t) with all the other pixel values Ixy(t+t’)</strong>.</p>
