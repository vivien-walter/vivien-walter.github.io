<p>Sentry is a <strong>control software</strong> for the iSCAT microscope constructed in my current research group.
The software is designed to control all the different equipments of the microscope: the <em>cameras</em>,
the <em>piezo-electric stage</em>, the <em>LASER</em> light source, the <em>shutter</em> and a <em>spatial light modulator</em>.
While the software is specific to our microscope, it is <strong>modulable</strong> enough to be adapted to any
kind of setup.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>Sentry, named after the <em>Boeing E-3</em>, is a software overseeing and controlling our <strong>iSCAT microscope</strong>
and all its equipments. The design of the user interface has been optimised to gather all the controls on
the main interface.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The advanced settings of the different elements can be accessed in separate menus, in order to keep the interface as
clean and simple as possible.</p>

<h2 id="equipment-support">Equipment support</h2>

<p>You can find described below the list of the different equipments currently supported by Sentry, as
well as a quick guide on how to integrate similar equipments in the software.</p>

<h3 id="cameras">Cameras</h3>

<p>The current cameras are already supported in Sentry:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>PCO. dimax</strong> cs1 and cs4</li>
  <li><strong>PhotonFocus</strong> D1024</li>
  <li><strong>FLIR</strong> Oryx</li>
  <li><strong>FLIR</strong> BlackFly S</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that the PhotonFocus D1024 is experiencing several bugs that we could not
solve (<em>e.g.</em> flickering).</p>

<p>To integrate a new camera, the following subVIs should be created:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Camera detection and initialisation.</li>
  <li>Apply settings to the camera: (i) region-of-interest, (ii) exposure time and (iii) frame rate.</li>
  <li>Grab a single image.</li>
  <li>Do an high-speed recording to save an image array.</li>
  <li>Close the camera safely.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="piezoelectric-stage">Piezoelectric stage</h3>

<p>The current piezoelectric stage supported by Sentry is the <strong>Physik Instrumente P-545-3R8S</strong>. To integrate
another piezoelectric stage, the following subVIs should be created:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Stage detection and initialisation.</li>
  <li>Read the current position of the stage.</li>
  <li>Set a new position to the stage.</li>
  <li>Close the stage safely.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="laser-source">LASER source</h3>

<p>The current LASER light source stage supported by Sentry is the <strong>Kvant Lasers RLM-6000M</strong>. The Kvant
Lasers is currently controlled by applying a voltage on the external input of the laser module. This
is done via a DAQ card.</p>

<p>To integrate another LASER or other type of light source, the following subVIs should be created:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Laser detection and initialisation.</li>
  <li>Read the current laser power.</li>
  <li>Set a new laser power.</li>
  <li>Close the laser safely.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="shutter">Shutter</h3>

<p>The current microscope shutter supported by Sentry is the <strong>Thorlabs SC10</strong>.</p>

<p>To integrate another shutter, the following subVIs should be created:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Shutter detection and initialisation.</li>
  <li>Read the current shutter status.</li>
  <li>Set the shutter status.</li>
  <li>Close the shutter safely.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="spatial-light-modulator">Spatial Light Modulator</h3>

<p>The current spatial light modulator (SLM) supported by Sentry is the <strong>Meadowlark Optics 1920x1152</strong>.
Integrating another spatial light modulator might not be as straightforward as the other types
of equipment. Please refer to the capacity of your SLM and the application desired to
see which subVIs you might need.</p>

<h2 id="details-on-the-code">Details on the code</h2>

<p>Sentry is based on the <strong>queueing system</strong> of LabVIEW and <strong>parallel loops</strong>. Briefly, only
the User Interface (UI) is accessible to the user. The user can <em>visualise</em> what is happening in Sentry
via the display, and can <em>interact</em> with the interface using buttons and all.</p>

<p>The UI does not do anything when a button or so is pressed. The event is captured and the corresponding
action is written into an <strong>instruction</strong>. This instruction is then sent by the UI to the specific equipment.
Once the equipment has read the instruction, it does the related <strong>action</strong> and eventually sends data back to the UI
for display. In this configuration, each equipment are enclosed in a <strong>separate and independant loop</strong>. By doing this,
the action of one piece of equipment shall not interfere with other equipment or slow down the software.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>However, it can happen that two components are or should be connected together. For example, one could
want to scan the sample and take a picture at each step. In this case, another type of loop is created,
called <strong>synchronisation loops</strong>. Synchronisation loops receive the orders from the UI, but do not interact
with the equipment directly. Instead, these loops send new orders to the equipment loops and wait for the results
to proceed.</p>
