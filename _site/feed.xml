I was a bit bored and tired of the previous version,
both because of the design but also because of the Django framework which is not fun at all
to edit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the transfer, I updated everything in the &lt;strong&gt;Research&lt;/strong&gt; section to make sure it really shows
what I am doing at the moment. I also replaced the Ressources section, which was showing too
many things and many useless ones to a simple &lt;strong&gt;Softwares&lt;/strong&gt; one. I also decided to put back
my &lt;strong&gt;Teaching&lt;/strong&gt; section, which I will fill over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still things left to do, mostly adding content to the Teaching section, but it is going
to take so much time that I have decided to deploy the site now and fill the section later.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Vivien WALTER, PhD</name></author><category term="website" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html">Welcome all to my brand new website!
