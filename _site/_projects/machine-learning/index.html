<p>In collaboration with the <a href="https://www.ics-cnrs.unistra.fr">Institut Charles Sadron</a> (Strasbourg, FR), I am investigating the thermodynamic
properties of lipid membranes generated by <strong>molecular dynamics (MD) simulations</strong>. My specific interest are the phase transitions and separations
that can occur when the temperature of the system vary. Using <strong>Machine Learning</strong> to analyse the lipid configurations, we aim at describing
complex lipid mixtures and phases using a two-state approach.</p>
