<hr />

<p>In collaboration with the <a href="https://www.ics-cnrs.unistra.fr">Institut Charles Sadron</a> (Strasbourg, FR), I am investigating the thermodynamic
properties of lipid membranes generated by <strong>molecular dynamics (MD) simulations</strong>. My specific interest are the phase transitions and separations
that can occur when the temperature of the system vary. Using <strong>Machine Learning</strong> to analyse the lipid configurations, we aim at describing
complex lipid mixtures and phases using a two-state approach.</p>

<h3 id="lipid-phases">Lipid phases</h3>

<p>One of the remarkable property of pure phospholipids bilayers is to exhibit thermodynamic transitions, meaning that they can be found in several phases; from the dense structured <strong>gel phase</strong> at low temperature to the fully <strong>disordered fluid phase</strong> which forms above a sharp transition called the melting transition. Many other phases have been identified in the last decades, such as the corrugated <strong>ripple phase</strong> appearing between the gel and fluid phases of phosphocholine (PC) lipids, or the <strong>ordered liquid phase</strong> formed by the presence of an important amount of cholesterol in the membranes.</p>

<p>We investigate thoroughly these different phases via MD simulations in order to fully characterise the lipid membranes simulated. This allow us to track interactions between various types of molecules, such as <strong>pollutants</strong>, and the membrane; and analyse how these molecules are able to <strong>modify the phase composition</strong> of the lipid membranes.</p>

<h3 id="machine-learning">Machine Learning</h3>

<p>To analyse the phases of the individual lipid composing a cell membrane, we decided to rely on <strong>Machine Learning</strong> (ML) analysis.
Our key concept is that the configurations of lipid molecules is expected to be radically different from the <strong>elongated densely packed gel</strong> phase
to the <strong>randomly oriented fluid phase</strong>. ML analysis have been for long proven critically efficient on differenciating objects by
their appearance, which we tried to apply here to lipids.</p>

<p>Our first codes were found extremely efficient at differentiating lipid phases (Check the section <em>Related publication(s)</em> below), with an <strong>average score of 95%</strong>
for most of the lipids used in all-atom. We are looking for different way to proceed, especially to <strong>unify all models and lipids types</strong>.</p>
