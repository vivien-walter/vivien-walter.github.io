<hr />

<p>As part of the <a href="http://markwallace.org">Wallace group</a> at King’s College London, I am
investigating label-free optical imaging of single molecules, using <strong>Interferometric Scattering</strong>
(iSCAT) microscopy. Using the fact that all particles can scatter light beams and that this scattered
beam can interfere with a reference light beam, we are able to image on our microscope individual metal particles
as small as 2nm and <strong>individual proteins and polymers as small as 100kg/mol</strong> at ultra high speeds (&gt; 10kHz).
Going beyond the limitations in space and time resolutions of other types of optical microscopes, we use this
technique to visualize key <strong>events and reactions in cells</strong> and other standard biophysical systems.</p>

<h3 id="technology">Technology</h3>

<p>Imaging ever smaller molecules is a constant challenge in research, which lead in the past to the development of new microscopy techniques, such as
the electron microscopy techniques or new fluorescence methods to image single molecules. While the former achieves remarkable details, it cannot image
a live biological process or track molecular interactions. And while the latter can record diffusion and interactions of single molecules, it relies on
the fluorescent probe conjugated with the molecule and is limited by the drawbacks of the probes: price and complexity of the conjugation, photobleaching, limits in time resolution, etc.</p>

<p>The <strong>iSCAT microscopy</strong>, initiated in the 1990s and developed then mostly through the impulsion of <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.93.037401">Vahid Sandoghdar’s group</a>,
is a microscope technique which allow to track the diffusion and interactions of single molecules without the drawbacks of the fluorescence: the technique can be used directly
with any label-free molecule (<em>e.g.</em> nanoparticles, proteins, polymers), and its speed is only limited by the technology of the camera and light source (<em>i.e.</em> up to 1,000,000 FPS with ultra-high-speed cameras).</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>For this project, I have build my own iSCAT microscope, which design can be described simply as it only requires a <strong>coherent light source</strong> (Laser), a <strong>microscope objective</strong>, a <strong>polarised beam splitter</strong> with a <strong>wave plate</strong>, and the <strong>camera</strong> for high-speed recording.</p>

<h3 id="systems">Systems</h3>

<p>iSCAT microscopy can be applied to any kind of system, as the method does not require any specific property from the object imaged. For this project, we focussed on two topics:</p>

<p>We first investigate in this project the formation of <strong>membrane pores</strong> in lipid bilayers. With the iSCAT, we can track proteins diffusing on the membrane, and analyse all the <strong>interactions</strong> leading to the formation of
pores and the <strong>kinetics</strong> associated to these events.</p>

<p>Exploring more artificial soft matter problematics, we also study <strong>polymers</strong> with the iSCAT. The microscopy technique will allow us to unveil new insights on the polymer <strong>properties</strong> and <strong>formations</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="supervision--collaborations">Supervision &amp; Collaboration(s)</h2>

<p>This project is supervised by Prof. <strong>Mark I Wallace</strong> from the <a href="http://markwallace.org">Department of Chemistry</a> of the King’s College London (London, UK). I am myself co-supervising, along with Prof. Wallace, the
PhD projects of <strong>Christopher L Parperis</strong> and <strong>Yujie Guo</strong>, respectively on membrane pores and polymers imaged in iSCAT.</p>

<p>The whole project is financed through a <strong>BBSRC grant</strong> with <a href="https://nanoporetech.com">Oxford Nanopore Technologies</a>.</p>

<p>The investigation on polymers are made within a collaboration with Prof. <strong>Rachel O’Reilly</strong> and Dr. <strong>Jeffrey Foster</strong> from the <a href="https://www.oreillygrouplab.com">University of Birmingham</a> (Birmingham, UK).</p>
