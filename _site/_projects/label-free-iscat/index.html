<p>As part of the <a href="http://markwallace.org">Wallace group</a> at Kingâ€™s College London, I am
investigating label-free optical imaging of single molecules, using <strong>Interferometric Scattering</strong>
(iSCAT) microscopy. Using the fact that all particles can scatter light beams and that this scattered
beam can interfere with a reference light beam, we are able to image on our microscope individual metal particles
as small as 2nm and <strong>individual proteins and polymers as small as 100kg/mol</strong> at ultra high speeds (&gt; 10kHz).
Going beyond the limitations in space and time resolutions of other types of optical microscopes, we use this
technique to visualize key <strong>events and reactions in cells</strong> and other standard biophysical systems.</p>
