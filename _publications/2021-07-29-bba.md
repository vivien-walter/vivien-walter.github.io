## Abstact

Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations have reached a degree of maturity that makes it possible to investigate the lipid polymorphism of model bilayers over a wide range of temperatures. However if both the fluid 
 and tilted gel states are routinely obtained, the ripple phase of phosphatidylcholine lipid bilayers is still unsatifactorily described. Performing simulations of lipid bilayers made of different numbers of DPPC (1,2-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine) molecules ranging from 32 to 512, we demonstrate that the tilted gel phase expected below the pretransition cannot be obtained for large systems (equal or larger than 94 DPPC molecules) through common simulations settings or temperature treatments. Large systems are instead found in a disordered gel phase which display configurations, topography and energies reminiscent from the ripple phase observed between the pretransition and the main melting transition. We show how the state of the bilayers below the melting transition can be controlled and depends on thermal history and conditions of preparations. A mechanism for the observed topographic instability is suggested.
