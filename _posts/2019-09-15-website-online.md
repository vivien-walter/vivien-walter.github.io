Welcome all to my **brand new website**! I was a bit bored and tired of the previous version,
both because of the design but also because of the Django framework which is not fun at all
to edit.

During the transfer, I updated everything in the **Research** section to make sure it really shows
what I am doing at the moment. I also replaced the Ressources section, which was showing too
many things and many useless ones to a simple **Softwares** one. I also decided to put back
my **Teaching** section, which I will fill over time.

There are still things left to do, mostly adding content to the Teaching section, but it is going
to take so much time that I have decided to deploy the site now and fill the section later.
