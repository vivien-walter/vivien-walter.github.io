I have just released a new Python module, **md2stl**, on GitHub

md2stl is a module including different tools that can be used to generate a .stl file ready to be 3d printed from a molecular dynamic (MD) simulation input file.

The complete documentation of the software, as well as some tutorials, can be found on GitHub:
