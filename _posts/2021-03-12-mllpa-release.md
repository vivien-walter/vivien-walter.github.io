MLLPA is a Machine Learning-based module used to analyse a lipid membrane obtained through MD simulation and **predict the phase of individual lipids**.
As a result, the membrane can be mapped to highlight phase domains.

The scientific article can be accessed on the [website of the publisher](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.26508).

The complete documentation of the software, as well as some tutorials, can be found on the official website or on GitHub:
