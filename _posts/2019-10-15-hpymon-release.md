I have just released a new Python software powered by a graphical user interface, **HPyMon**.

HPyMon is used to monitor the status of the calculation **jobs running on a high-performance computing (HPC) center** and display
the list of the jobs with all the relevant information.

The software and its source code can be downloaded on the related GitHub page:
